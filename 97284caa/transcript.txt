I THANK CHINA ALL THE TIME.
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU SAW A
CHEVROLET IN TOKYO?
WHEN DO WE BEAT MEXICO AT THE
BORDER?
THEY'RE LAUGHING AT US.
THEY'RE BRINGING DRUGS, THEY'RE
BRINGING CRIME, THEIR RAPISTS.

$5 BILLION WE SPENT ON A
WEBSITE.
I HIRE PEOPLE, THEY DO A
WEBSITE.
IT COSTS ME $3.
ARE YOU RUNNING?
ARE YOU NOT RUNNING?
I AM OFFICIALLY RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
WE NEED A LEADER THAT WROTE THE
ART OF THE DEAL.
I WILL BE THE GREATEST JOBS
PRESIDENT THAT GOD EVER CREATED.
FREE TRADE CAN BE WONDERFUL IF
YOU HAVE SMART PEOPLE, BUT WE
HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE STUPID.
I LIKE CHINA.
I JUST SOLD AN APARTMENT FOR $15
